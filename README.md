# BluePrintCreation
This project will create factorio blueprints according to given rules

used libraries:
Java:
  -PApplet (processing core)
  
Phyton:
  -base64
  -zlib

_Final file created by the phyton project is unfinished.
The first two and the last character have to get removed.
If this shall be imported to factorio it has to be assigned a version. In the current case this just means adding a "0" to the output file._

Final file no longer contains errors. The final blueprint string is importable as is.
